# -YATRIK-Intelligent-Tourist-Guide-System-for-Uttarakhand
Recommender System for travel in Uttarakhand.

1- Collection of data about Tourist places in Uttarakhand, to create an excel about 172 places(mostly unexplored) with scores based on different aspects of travelling.

2- Data Modelling on the dataset using python and data science libraries(Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot, json).

3- Division of places among clusters based on scores, by making use of Machine learning(K-Means Algorithm, sklearn.cluster, sklearn.decomposition)

4- Defined similarities among all the places by using Cosine-Similarity model(Content-Based Filtering) to give recommendations based on previous visits.

5- Created a simple GUI for the model by using python (Tkinter) to give recommendations to the user.
